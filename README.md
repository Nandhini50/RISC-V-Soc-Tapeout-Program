# RISC-V-Soc-Tapeout-Program
🖥️ RISC-V SoC Tapeout Journey – VSD

This repository is my personal logbook for the VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program.
It captures week-by-week activities, tasks, and reflections as I explore the complete SoC design cycle.

The program offers a unique opportunity to learn how a System-on-Chip is built from scratch — beginning with RTL design and moving all the way to generating the GDSII. As part of one of India’s largest collaborative RISC-V efforts, this initiative is enabling thousands of engineers to actively contribute to the country’s semiconductor ecosystem.

📅 Week 0 — Tool Setup & Verification

Task 0	🛠️ ----> Installed Icarus Verilog, Yosys, and GTKWave for simulation, synthesis, and waveform analysis	
🌟 Learnings from Week 0

Hands-on experience in setting up essential open-source EDA tools.

Understood their role in the RTL → Physical Design flow.

Environment is now fully prepared for upcoming design experiments.

🙏 Acknowledgments

A heartfelt thanks to Kunal Ghosh and the VSD team for creating this structured, hands-on learning path.
Gratitude also to RISC-V International, ISM, VSI, and Efabless for supporting this large-scale open-source silicon initiative.
