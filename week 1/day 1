INTRODUCTION TO IVERILOG DESIGN TEST BENCH
Simulator
   A simulator is a software or hardware tool that imitates the behavior of a real-world system, circuit, or process so you can study, test, or verify it without actually building the physical system.
   Basically here RTL design is checked for its adherence to the spec by simulating the design

Here , IVERILOG is the tool is used as simulator
     
▶️ Running the Simulation

Compile and simulate:

iverilog -o sim/sim.out src/design.v tb/testbench.v
vvp sim/sim.out


View waveform:

gtkwave sim/wave.vcd
 you can view the invoke of iverilog by cloning all the files from git

GTKWave

GTKWave is a waveform viewer used to visualize signal activity from Verilog/VHDL simulations.
It reads VCD (Value Change Dump), LXT, or FST files generated during simulation.
Helps debug timing, check logic, and verify your DUT (Design Under Test).

for example the GTKWave waveform can be viewed in day1/gtkwave.png
